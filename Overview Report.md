For the Key Influencers chart, I set the "Scrapped" column as the column to be analyzed using the following metrics
* Average delay in start days (delay in beginning the production)

* Average Cost (the Actual cost column)

* Average production days (days it took to complete the production)

These were the insight gotten from the analysis: 
* When the Actual cost goes down by <strong> 11.48 </strong>, the likelihood of the production getting scrapped increases by <strong> 1.16x </strong>

* When the delay in start days goes up by <strong> 5.96 </strong>, the likelihood of the production getting scrapped increases by <strong> infinity </strong>

* When the average production days goes up by <strong> 8.38 </strong>, the likelihood of the production getting scrapped increases by <strong> 1.71x </strong>

* Misaligned wheel

* The trim length being too short

* Stress test failure

* Gouge in the metal

* The trim length being too long

* Primer process failed

* Drill size too small

* Drill size too large

* Incorrect color
